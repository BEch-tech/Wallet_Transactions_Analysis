# Wallet_Transactions_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analysing transaction data from a fictional digital wallet company based in India. The primary objective is to clean, process, and analyse the data to extract meaningful insights. Python's Pandas library was used for data manipulation, and the analysis was conducted in a Jupyter notebook within Visual Studio Code. The results were visualised using Power BI to create interactive dashboards highlighting key transaction trends, user behavior, and other patterns.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: For data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Pandas**: To manipulate and explore the dataset
- **Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)**: For conducting interactive analysis
- **Power BI**: For visualising insights through dashboards

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed unesscessary columns, added new columns, and normalised the dataset.
- **Transaction Analysis**: Identified trends such as transaction frequency based on products, user segments, and patterns in transaction types.
- **Visualisation**: Created detailed dashboards to present insights in an easy-to-understand format.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of fictional digital wallet transactions, containing fields like:
- **merchant_name**: Column for each merchants name
- **product_category**: Consolidates each products name into their respective categories
- **payment_amount**: Transaction value
- **date**: When the transaction took place
- **payment_methods**: Bank Transfer, Debit Card, UPI, Credit Card or Wallet Balance

## Notebooks
- `clean_digital_wallet.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook where data cleaning, exploration, and analysis were performed.
  
## Visualisations
The insights derived from the analysis were visualised using Power BI. Key visualisations include:
- **Total Spend by Product and Month**: Showing trends in transactions according to Total Spend.
- **Cashback and Loyalty Points**: Total amount of cashback and loyalty points according to month and location.
- **Transaction Type Breakdown**: Differentiating between the various payement methods.

## Results
The analysis revealed:
- Which merchants were the most popular within certain months and locations
- Products contributing to the majority of transactions.
- Clear distinctions between payment methods, showing trends between successful and failed transactions and spending behaviours.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook and Power BI visualizations for a deeper understanding of the analysis process and findings.
